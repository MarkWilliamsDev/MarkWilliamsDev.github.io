                  A "self taught" web developer based in Malvern, UK, I enjoy learning and using new
                  technologies. I'm currently looking for my first professional opportunity to put
                  my knowledge and skills to use

                  then decided to get into web development and after spending time on Codecademy
                  learning Javascript, I focused on learning React.

                  In my spare time I enjoy listening to music and playing bass, which I play in a
                  band for a traditional folk dance group. I've also recently started to learn the
                  trumpet.
